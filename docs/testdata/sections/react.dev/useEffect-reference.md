<Intro>

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you [synchronize a component with an external system.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```js
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useEffect(setup, dependencies?)` {/*useeffect*/}

Call `useEffect` at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

[See more examples below.](#usage)

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `setup`: The function with your Effect's logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a *cleanup* function. When your [component commits](/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom), React will run your setup function. After every commit with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

* **optional** `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `setup` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every commit of the component. [See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.](#examples-dependencies)

#### Returns {/*returns*/}

`useEffect` returns `undefined`.

#### Caveats {/*caveats*/}

* `useEffect` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

* If you're **not trying to synchronize with some external system,** [you probably don't need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)

* When Strict Mode is on, React will **run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle** before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic "mirrors" your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, [implement the cleanup function.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

* If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will **cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed.** To fix this, remove unnecessary [object](#removing-unnecessary-object-dependencies) and [function](#removing-unnecessary-function-dependencies) dependencies. You can also [extract state updates](#updating-state-based-on-previous-state-from-an-effect) and [non-reactive logic](#reading-the-latest-props-and-state-from-an-effect) outside of your Effect.

* If your Effect wasn't caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser **paint the updated screen first before running your Effect.** If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)

* If your Effect is caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may run your Effect before the browser paints the updated screen**. This ensures that the result of the Effect can be observed by the event system. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an `alert()`, you can use `setTimeout`. See [reactwg/react-18/128](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/128) for more information.

* Even if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), **React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect.** Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace `useEffect` with [`useLayoutEffect`.](/reference/react/useLayoutEffect)

* Effects **only run on the client.** They don't run during server rendering.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Connecting to an external system {/*connecting-to-an-external-system*/}

Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren't controlled by React, so they are called *external.*

To [connect your component to some external system,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) call `useEffect` at the top level of your component:

```js [[1, 8, "const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);"], [1, 9, "connection.connect();"], [2, 11, "connection.disconnect();"], [3, 13, "[serverUrl, roomId]"]]
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
  	const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
  	return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
  	};
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

You need to pass two arguments to `useEffect`:

1. A *setup function* with <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> that connects to that system.
   - It should return a *cleanup function* with <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> that disconnects from that system.
2. A <CodeStep step={3}>list of dependencies</CodeStep> including every value from your component used inside of those functions.

**React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it's necessary, which may happen multiple times:**

1. Your <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> runs when your component is added to the page *(mounts)*.
2. After every commit of your component where the <CodeStep step={3}>dependencies</CodeStep> have changed:
   - First, your <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> runs with the old props and state.
   - Then, your <CodeStep step={1}>setup code</CodeStep> runs with the new props and state.
3. Your <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup code</CodeStep> runs one final time after your component is removed from the page *(unmounts).*

**Let's illustrate this sequence for the example above.**

When the `ChatRoom` component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial `serverUrl` and `roomId`. If either `serverUrl` or `roomId` change as a result of a commit (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will *disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one.* When the `ChatRoom` component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.

**To [help you find bugs,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) in development React runs <CodeStep step={1}>setup</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>cleanup</CodeStep> one extra time before the <CodeStep step={1}>setup</CodeStep>.** This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect's logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn't be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a *setup* → *cleanup* → *setup* sequence (as in development). [See common solutions.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development)

**Try to [write every Effect as an independent process](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#each-effect-represents-a-separate-synchronization-process) and [think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time.](/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#thinking-from-the-effects-perspective)** It shouldn't matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly "mirrors" the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.

<Note>

An Effect lets you [keep your component synchronized](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with some external system (like a chat service). Here, *external system* means any piece of code that's not controlled by React, such as:

* A timer managed with <CodeStep step={1}>[`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval)</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>[`clearInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearInterval)</CodeStep>.
* An event subscription using <CodeStep step={1}>[`window.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>[`window.removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)</CodeStep>.
* A third-party animation library with an API like <CodeStep step={1}>`animation.start()`</CodeStep> and <CodeStep step={2}>`animation.reset()`</CodeStep>.

**If you're not connecting to any external system, [you probably don't need an Effect.](/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)**

#### Connecting to a chat server {/*connecting-to-a-chat-server*/}

In this example, the `ChatRoom` component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in `chat.js`. Press "Open chat" to make the `ChatRoom` component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as [explained here.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-3-add-cleanup-if-needed) Try changing the `roomId` and `serverUrl` using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press "Close chat" to see the Effect disconnect one last time.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Server URL:{' '}
        <input
          value={serverUrl}
          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>
        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}
      </button>
      {show && <hr />}
      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

```js src/chat.js
export function createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) {
  // A real implementation would actually connect to the server
  return {
    connect() {
      console.log('✅ Connecting to "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl + '...');
    },
    disconnect() {
      console.log('❌ Disconnected from "' + roomId + '" room at ' + serverUrl);
    }
  };
}
```

```css
input { display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }
button { margin-left: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

#### Listening to a global browser event {/*listening-to-a-global-browser-event*/}

In this example, the external system is the browser DOM itself. Normally, you'd specify event listeners with JSX, but you can't listen to the global [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object this way. An Effect lets you connect to the `window` object and listen to its events. Listening to the `pointermove` event lets you track the cursor (or finger) position and update the red dot to move with it.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity: 0.6,
      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}
```

```css
body {
  min-height: 300px;
}
```
